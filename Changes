Revision history for MoarVM::Profile

{{$NEXT}}
    - Renamed "Callable" to "Block" in documentation, as that
      is closer to what a ::Routine object refers to
    - Removed ::SpeshOverview and Profile.spesh-overviews: the
      information was a subset of what ::RoutineOverview
      provides
    - Removed ::Routine.overview, added all accessors of the
      ::RoutineOverview class to ::Routine, making the
      ::RoutineOverview class an implementation detail
